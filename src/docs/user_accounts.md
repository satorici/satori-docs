# Intro
## User Accounts

All Satori CI users get the common benefits of the platform:
- [Run](mode_run.md)
- [CI](github_ci.md)
- [Monitor](mode_monitor.md)
- [Notifications](notifications.md)
- Multiple UIs ([CLI](https://github.com/satorici/satori-cli), [Web](https://www.satori-ci.com), Grafana, [API](http://api.satori-ci.com/schema/swagger)
- [Playbook Marketplace](https://github.com/satorici/playbooks)

The difference between account roles is related to the amount of daily executions, availability and type of testing support that is required:
